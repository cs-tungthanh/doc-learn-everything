> Aims to build a system that are reliable.
- One key of reliable system is **AVAILABILITY**.

It's also helpful to think of availability as the resiliency of a system.
If a system is robust enough to handle failures in the network, database, servers etc, then it can generally be considered to be a fault-tolerant system - which makes it an available system.

# Design High Availability
> You need to reduce or eliminate **single points of failure**. 

# SLAs - Service Level Agreement.
