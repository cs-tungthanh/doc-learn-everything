# Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
	Id int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
	Name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE UserFollow (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    UserId INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES User(Id),
    FollowingId INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES User(Id),
	PRIMARY KEY (UserId, FollowingId)
    INDEX composite_index (UserId, FollowingId)
);
%%%% select user who have more than 5 followers
SELECT 
    FollowingId, COUNT(*)
FROM UserFollow
GROUP BY FollowingId
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
```

### Query

- **GROUP BY**: group by object
- **ORDER BY**: sort data `ORDER BY condition1, condition2, .., n`
	- it will check from left to right (condition1 would be checked first)
- **HAVING**: sort data after grouping — only use in **SELECT** + placed after **GROUP BY**.
	- Because WHERE cannot use aggregate functions like **SUM**, **COUNT**
- **WHERE** is to filter rows in a particular table
- **HAVING** is to filter rows of the final result set.

```sql
SELECT column1, function(column2)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING condition;

// it is also valid - no need to have GROUP BY
SELECT SUM(LineTotal) AS SubTotal
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
HAVING SUM(LineTotal) > 1000
```

### Merge table
- JOIN: merge table horizontal - combining the data from multiple tables based on a common field between them.
    - INNER: selects all rows from both tables as long as the condition is satisfied.
    - LEFT: return all rows from the left table and matching rows for the table on the right side. If there’s no matching the result will contain NULL value
    - Right
    - FULL: combining results of both LEFT and RIGHT JOIN
    - CROSS JOIN: this is a type of join that returns the Cartesian **product of rows from the tables** in the join. In other words, it combines each row from the first table with each row from the second table.
    - SELF JOIN: (self join to get date before day, user_id with supervisor_id)
        - supervisor ID matches with the ID
- UNION: merge table by vertical

### Built-in Function
- Scalar function: thao tac tren tung row → return 1 value: CONVERTION, DATE & TIME, STRING, …
- Logical function: CASE… WHEN, IIF, CHOOSE, ISNULL,…
- Ranking function: `RANK, ROW_NUMBER,…`
- Aggregate: `MIN, MAX, SUM,…`

### Query in sub-table
- Subquery
- CTE (Common table expression): `WITH AS`

## Key points
1. HAVING and WHERE?
```sql
SELECT info.roll_number, info.name
FROM examination_marks as mark
LEFT JOIN student_information as info
ON info.roll_number = mark.roll_number
WHERE mark.subject_one+mark.subject_two+mark.subject_three < 100
;
```

## SELECT
- `DISTINCT`

## String - Function
```sql
- RIGHT("text", number_of_chars) | LEFT("text", number_of_chars)
+ num = 1 -> return 't' //ex for right
+ num = 12-> return 'xt'// ex for right

WHERE value IN ('item1', 'item2');
```

### Example using COUNT
```sql
SELECT 
    N,
    IF (P IS NULL, 
        'Root',
        IF (
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BST AS B2 WHERE B2.P=B1.N) > 0,
        'Inner', 'Leaf')
    )
FROM BST AS B1
ORDER BY N;
```

# CLI
```docker
docker run --name mysql-play -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret -d mysql:latest
docker exec -it mysql-play mysql -p
CREATE DATABASE db_playground;
```

```sql
show databases;
show tables;
use database_name;
describe table_name;

SELECT DATABASE();      to verify you are using the database, then
SELECT @TX_ISOLATION;    for the DB TX isolation value
SELECT @@TX_ISOLATION;   for global TX isolation value

// used to check the lock
select * from performance_schema.data_locks; 
select ENGINE, ENGINE_TRANSACTION_ID, LOCK_TYPE, LOCK_MODE, LOCK_STATUS, LOCK_DATA from performance_schema.data_locks;

// check isolation level
SELECT @@GLOBAL.transaction_isolation, @@GLOBAL.transaction_read_only;
SELECT @@SESSION.transaction_isolation, @@SESSION.transaction_read_only;
```

# Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(c2,c3,c4);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_idx_1 ON table_name (c1);

SHOW EXTENDED INDEX FROM table_name;

EXPLAIN SELECT *  WHERE FirstName='a' AND LastName='b'
EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON SELECT *  WHERE FirstName='a' AND LastName='b'
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE test (
    ID int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name varchar(200) NOT NULL,
    SecondName varchar(200),
    Age int
);
```

# Built-in function
- Select is used to retrieve or fetch data from DB.
- DISTINCT is used in conjunction with `SELECT` → avoid duplicating rows
- `SELECT DISTINCT col1, col2 FROM table`
	- → return all the unique combinations of rows with fields col1, and col2 
	- (col1, col2) is a unique key.


## Optimization

### Truncate vs Delete

- **TRUNCATE** is faster than **DELETE**
- **as it doesn't scan every record before removing it**
- TRUNCATE TABLE locks the whole table to remove data from a table; thus, this command also uses less transaction space than DELETE.
- Unlike DELETE, TRUNCATE does not return the number of rows deleted from the table and it will reset the table auto-increment value to the starting value.
- [TRUNCATE TABLE vs. DELETE vs. DROP TABLE: Removing Tables and Data in SQL | [LearnSQL.com](http://LearnSQL.com)]([https://learnsql.com/blog/difference-between-truncate-delete-and-drop-table-in-sql/#:~:text=TRUNCATE is faster than DELETE,rows deleted from the table.)](https://learnsql.com/blog/difference-between-truncate-delete-and-drop-table-in-sql/#:~:text=TRUNCATE%20is%20faster%20than%20DELETE,rows%20deleted%20from%20the%20table.))

# Index

- It is better to index to the **Foreign Key** of tables.
- Create [composite indexes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/multiple-column-indexes.html) based on the actual **WHERE** clauses of your queries

### EXIST - COUNT(*)

COUNT: will be a full table scan

- EXIST: is used to check for the existence of any record in a subquery

`SELECT * FROM table1 t WHERE EXISTS (SELECT columnName FROM table2 WHERE condition);`

`SELECT * FROM table1 GROUP BY colName HAVING COUNT(*) > 0`

- EXISTS: can typically be optimized very easily into a very fast operation.
    - after one entry is found → it will stop searching
- COUNT: is quite a bit harder to optimize easily - group by and such is involved.

# Deadlock

```bash
Scenario: 
+ A transfer to B
+ B transfer to A

1. begin transaction;
3. lock id 1
5. lock id 2 -> deadlock
update account set balance=balance-10 where id = 1;
update account set balance=balance+10 where id = 2;
commit;

2. begin transaction;
4. lock id 2
lock id 1
update account set balance=balance-10 where id = 2;
update account set balance=balance+10 where id = 1;
commit;

---- Resolve --- sort by Id first and update
begin transaction;
lock 1
lock 2
update account set balance=balance-10 where id = 1;
update account set balance=balance+10 where id = 2;
commit;

begin transaction;
lock 1
lock 2
update account set balance=balance+10 where id = 1;
update account set balance=balance-10 where id = 2;
commit;
```
