OAuth is a way to grant permission to a service that can access to get resource without having username/password or credentials to take action.

First we have a resource owner(User), a main server(SnapStore) stores photo and a outside service(PrintMagic) which want to access your photo.
So OAuth is a way to grant the outside service can get the resource of User without having account of User.
